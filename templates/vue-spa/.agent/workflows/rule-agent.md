# Rule Agent

Aggregate applicable rules for Vue.js frontend development.

## Steps

### 1. Collect Global Rules
Read from:
- `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`
- Global `.cursorrules`

### 2. Collect Project Rules
Read from:
- `.agent/rules/project.md`
- Project-level `.cursorrules`

### 3. Collect Frontend Rules
Read from:
- `rules/frontend/vue-3.md`
- `rules/frontend/pinia.md`
- `rules/frontend/vue-router.md`
- `rules/frontend/composables.md`
- `rules/frontend/typescript.md`
- `rules/frontend/api-integration.md`
- `rules/frontend/security.md`
- `rules/frontend/testing.md`

### 4. Collect Core Rules
Read from:
- `rules/core/solid.md`
- `rules/core/clean-code.md`
- `rules/core/oop.md`
- `rules/core/patterns.md`

### 5. Merge and Prioritize
Priority order (highest to lowest):
1. Project-specific overrides
2. Frontend rules
3. Core rules
4. Global rules

### 6. Output Active Rules
Generate `active-rules.md`:
```markdown

## Testing
- 70% coverage minimum
- Unit tests for composables
- Component tests for logic

## Clean Code

- No magic numbers
```

## Return Condition
Return when `active-rules.md` contains all applicable rules merged and prioritized.
