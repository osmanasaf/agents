# Refactor Java

- Target SOLID + Clean Code violations (SRP, OCP, ISP, DIP, long methods/classes, magic numbers, duplication).
- Prefer composition, extraction, and polymorphism; keep DDD boundaries intact.
- Keep public APIs stable; extend instead of breaking contracts.
- Update/add unit tests for domain logic and integration tests for services touched.
- Return a short list of refactors and affected files.
